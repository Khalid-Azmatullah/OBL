> [Important] THE OBL SYNTAX IS CHANGING HENCE THE CODE IS NOT FUNCTIONING RIGHT NOW.

# OBL

OBL or 'Other Basic Language' is a python project that aims at creating an extremely realistic experience of coding in an actual language. It functions similarly as an COL but is of course not a real language.
<strong>It is currently very uncertain that I continue with this project because of it's low scope in becoming a worth while project.</strong>

### How to use:

To use OBL just create a file with extension '.obl' and insert the following example code:
```
venv {
  main.console(0) {
    # This is a comment
    console.output("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

Now run the 'obl.py' file to compile this program by typing:
```
obl.compile {file_name}.obl
```

By doing this you will get the following output:
```
Hello World!
0
```
### Other Features
That's it! Like I said this project is too complex and needs all my attention. But I cannot use my time for this project as I'd rather spend my time coding something useful as well as meaningful! Maybe one day I will continue this endeavour and make a true OBL.
